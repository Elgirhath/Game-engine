# Game-engine

This is a game engine realised for a "Introduction to programming" course on the first semester of Computer Science on AGH UST. The task was to create a game with pygame, but I didn't really want to create a 2D game, so I built a 3D engine first.

The engine supports:

* 3D rendering
* Importing 3D models with color materials
* Collision detection
* Rigidbodies and gravity
* Raycasts
* Sounds
* Text display
* Transformations and quaternion rotations

### How to run

To run the game you will need python, [pygame](https://www.pygame.org), [numpy](https://numpy.org) and [quaternion](https://pypi.org/project/numpy-quaternion/). Then just run:

```
python ./TheGame.py
```

## The game

This game has no name but can be used as a famous Kovaak's aim training alternative (I've been using it myself). While the engine was written for around 4 months the game was written in just a few sleepless hours before the deadline.
