# Game-engine

This game engine is built with python and a library Pygame. It provides user with libraries responsible for loading objects from .obj files, setting materials, importing images, transforming objects (including moving, scaling and rotating by any axis), setting custom colliders, creating sound sources and mixing the sound.

I have built a basic game using the engine, in which a player can shoot the targets and interact with objects and buttons. It presents the work of colliders, ray collision of shooting, changing materials of the targets and gravity.

**Why was it created with Python? It's probably the worst language for game engine...**

*On the first semester of studies I had to create a project with Python and I actually used this project there. It also taught me a lot about this language.*
