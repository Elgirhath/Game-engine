# Game-engine

This game engine is built with python and a library Pygame. It provides user with libraries responsible loading objects from .obj files, setting materials, importing images, transforming objects (including moving, scaling and rotating by any axis) and setting custom colliders.

I have built a basic game using the engine, in which a player can shoot the targets and interact with objects and buttons. It presents the work of colliders, ray collision of shooting changing materials of the targets and gravity.
